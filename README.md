## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to classify air quality using machine learning techniques, with a focus on the impact on human health. Thus, the proposed work concentrates on classifying air quality into five classes: ‘very low’, 'low', 'moderate', 'high', and 'very high'. We aim to deduce actionable insights from the data that can help stakeholders arrive at more prudent decisions toward ensuring public health.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience
This analysis is intended for organizational decision-makers focused on air quality and human health, including public health officials and environmental policymakers. Ideally, it is envisioned to provide these stakeholders, at the end, with a wide view of how different levels of air pollution influence various health outcomes. It is expected that this knowledge will contribute to formulating policies and interventions that are informed and simultaneously improve the management of public health and environmental quality.

### Dataset Choice
The dataset selected for the project includes a range of air quality indicators such as AQI, PM2.5, PM10, O3 (Ozone), and NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), and meteorological features like humidity, wind speed, and temperature. The dataset is chosen in such a way that it could represent an overall aspect of pollution within the air and possible health implications.

## Modeling

### Classification Approach
Classification modeling was implemented to handle the problem of air quality impact prediction. In general, classification is a type of machine learning where data points are assigned into predefined categories according to their features. In this context, it helps us categorize air quality into different levels of impact, which can be used for assessing and predicting health risks associated with various levels of pollution.

### Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: This is a simpler model, and for this reason, it is a good first-order approximation for most evaluations. While it provides some insights, it performs poorly in this context, particularly for minority class predictions.
- **Random Forest**: This more complex and robust model significantly outperforms Logistic Regression. Further tuning was done to maximize the accuracy of this model.

## Evaluation

### Model Performance
- **Logistic Regression**: This classifier provided some insights but was unsatisfactory in terms of accuracy, particularly for the minority class predictions. Overall, its performance was disappointing in this project.
- **Random Forest**: This model produced commendable results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. After tuning, it continued to show good performance, making it a reliable choice for predicting health impacts from air quality.


### Key Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The frequency at which the model makes correct predictions.
- **F1 Score**: A measure of the balance between precision and recall, providing an idea of how well the model performs across all categories.
- **Precision**: Reflects the model's ability to avoid false positives.
- **Recall**: Reflects the model’s ability to identify true positives.
- **ROC AUC Score**: Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between different classes.

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model proved to be the most efficient tool in predicting the impact of air quality on human health. It gave excellent accuracy with good balance over all metrics. This analysis also underlined the issue of class imbalance as an important issue to take into consideration for further perfection of the model. Among the important features were AQI and PM2.5, which had a greater influence than the other features included in this model in predicting health impacts.
